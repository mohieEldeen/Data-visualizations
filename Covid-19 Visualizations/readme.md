# Covid-19 Visualizations
These visualizations is based on kaggle data on covid-19 competition.<br>
the visualization data is updated until 30th of mars.<br>

First, you choose a country then there will be 4 visualizations:
1. Recovered cases
2. Total infected cases
3. deceased cases
4. the daily increment 

<br>

In that project, I used the wedgits from Ipython to make it easy to choose the wanted country.<br>
And I used the canvas event from matplotlib to track down the mouse cursor morion, to find it's cordinates in any polt and to tell the number of affected cases.
